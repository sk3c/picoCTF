# Cookie Monster Secret Recipe

## Overview

Cookie Monster has hidden his top‑secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. Your objective is to investigate the site, locate the hidden artifact, and recover the recipe (the flag). This is a web‑application capture‑the‑flag (CTF) style challenge designed to test web reconnaissance and cookie‑related exploitation techniques.

Objective

Recover the hidden recipe (the flag) by identifying and decrypting the cookie used by the site.

## Reconnaissance

The challenge begins at a login page. You may submit arbitrary credentials to proceed.

After login, the application redirects to a page that displays a message related to cookies.

Application behavior and responses on this page are essential for further analysis.

## Exploitation

The site stores state in an application cookie. Careful inspection of this cookie, including its structure and encoding, is required.

Extract and decrypt (or otherwise decode) the cookie payload; successful decryption will reveal the flag.
