# Crack The Gate 1

**Challenge**: Simple picoCTF web challenge — bypass a login form to retrieve the flag.

## Summary

The web application presents a login form. Supplying the provided email with any random password fails, so the goal is to find a way to bypass authentication. Inspecting the page source reveals a developer comment that looks like gibberish; its first four characters are ABGR. That hint points to a ROT13-encoded message left by the developer.

## Recon

After loading the login page, view the HTML source. There is a suspicious comment that appears to be garbage text but begins with ABGR. That sequence is a clear hint: it’s the ROT13 encoding for the word “NOTE” (rotating each letter by 13 positions yields readable text). This suggests the developer accidentally left a hidden, encoded message in the page source.

## Exploitation

Apply ROT13 to the comment (many online tools or simple scripts can do this). Decoding the string reveals the developer’s bypass method — the exact flaw they left intentionally. Using that bypass as instructed in the decoded comment lets you authenticate and retrieve the flag.

## Conclusion

The challenge hinges on spotting and decoding a ROT13-encoded developer comment in the page source. Decoding the comment reveals the login bypass and ultimately the flag.
