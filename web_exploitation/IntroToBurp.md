## Recon
On the website there's a registration form.
* Submitting random values takes us to a different page where it asks for an OTP for 2FA.
* A random OTP returns “Invalid OTP.”
* Inspecting other parts (source code and so on) returned nothing useful.

This means we need to bypass the OTP using other means.
## Exploitation
Exploitation can be attempted in different ways: brute-forcing the OTP, or trying to bypass the field in the request. But first and foremost, it's important to play with the request fields. In many CTFs and forms, servers sometimes cannot handle malformed requests and can be bypassed.
### Parameter Manipulation Approach
* In Burp Suite, capture the request and send it to Repeater.
* In Repeater, sending an empty otp field returns “Invalid OTP.”
* Remove the otp field entirely. Upon sending the request without the otp parameter, the server returned our flag along with the details provided at the beginning.


## Conclusion
Trying multiple approaches is important before coming to a conclusion. I also tried brute-forcing for a few minutes before I realized I should try manipulating the parameters first.
