Can you get the flag?

## Recon

The website provides a brief explanation of header files, which are typically included in other files. A button labeled "Say Hello" triggers a response when clicked, revealing the message: "This code is in a separate file!" Upon inspecting the page's source code, we discover two header files.

## Exploitation

Both the style.css and script.js files contain partial portions of the flag, split between them.

## Conclusion

Effective enumeration is a crucial skill for any hacker, as it allows for the discovery of hidden information and vulnerabilities.
