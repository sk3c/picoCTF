# Get aHEAD

Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition.

## Recon

Upon loading the website, we notice two buttons (Red and Blue) within forms. These buttons trigger requests to the server when clicked, indicating that the site uses HTTP methods like GET or POST to handle requests. By inspecting the page source, we can confirm that these buttons are part of forms which submit data. This suggests that there may be other HTTP methods, apart from GET and POST, which could provide additional information or even the hidden flag.

## Exploitation

Using Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP requests, we test different HTTP methods. We find that by changing the request method to HEAD, we receive the flag in the response headers. The HEAD method returns only the headers without the body, and in this case, the flag is included in one of the response headers, hidden from regular GET or POST requests.

## Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates that exploring non-standard HTTP methods like HEAD can reveal hidden data such as flags. A solid understanding of how HTTP methods work and testing various methods can uncover security issues or secrets hidden behind the scenes.
