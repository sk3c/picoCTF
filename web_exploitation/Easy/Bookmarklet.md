# Bookmarklet

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?


## Recon

After opening the website, we are presented with a page containing some code and a message stating that our browser has received the flag.

* In the page source we find nothing useful.
* The code block contains a JavaScript gist. If we understand it correctly, this should alert us with the flag.

## Exploitation

To exploit this code we can use any online JavaScript editor. Paste the code, make it functional by adding a name and removing unnecessary syntax. On execution, we are presented with the flag.

## Conclusion

Understanding how code works and how basic logic is written can be extremely useful when doing hacking or any other task.
