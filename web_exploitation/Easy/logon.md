## Solution
** Step 1: Identify the Login Process **
The page presents a login form where we can attempt to log in using random credentials.
Based on the description, we need to log in as the user joe, but no password is provided for this user.
However, there is an admin variable present in the cookies, which is currently set to False.

** Step 2: Toggle the admin Variable **
By modifying or toggling the admin variable to True, we can access the flag.
Visit /flag after toggling the variable, and the flag will be displayed.
