# INSP3CT0R

** Description **
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:

** Vulnerability **
Infomration Disclouser

** Level **
Easy

## Solution
** Step 1: **
We need to inspect the source code of the website to retrieve different parts of the flag.
* The first part of the flag is embedded in the HTML.
* The middle part is found in the CSS.
* The final part is stored in JavaScript.

By extracting these sections and combining them, we can reconstruct the full flag.
