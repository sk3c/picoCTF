# Unminify

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!


## Recon

* Launched the vulnerable instance and visited the provided link.
* The page displayed a message indicating the flag had already been delivered to the browser context (commonly phrased like “flag delivered to your browser”).
* Page source was minified (all HTML on one line or heavily squashed), which makes eyeballing attributes harder.
* Using the browser’s “View Source” and Developer Tools (Elements panel) allowed inspecting the DOM. The flag was embedded in a class attribute on an HTML element (e.g., <div class="...FLAG...">).

## Conclusion
Paying attention to minor details is very important when solving a CTF or even performing a real attack. It's the only
difference between a good and great hacker.
