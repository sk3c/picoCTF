# Web Decode

## Summary

Do you know how to use the web inspector?

## Recon

The CTF website is a minimal web application with several pages and little visible information. The static source code does not reveal much. While inspecting each page using the browser's developer tools, we discovered the string notify_true embedded in the About page source. It appears to be an encoded value.

## Exploitation

Using simple hash-detection techniques, we identified the string as Base64-encoded. Decoding this Base64 value with any standard decoder reveals the flag.
