Can you get the flag?

## Recon

Upon visiting the website, we see a login form with a message instructing users to use only letters and numbers for the username and password.

* The page source contains little information.
* After trying random credentials, we are redirected to the Login Failed page.
* The source of the Login Failed page includes the code that verifies the username and password.
* A JavaScript file named secure.js is present; inspecting it reveals the username and password.

## Exploitation

Use the credentials found in secure.js to obtain the flag.
